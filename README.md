# Project 5: Shape Grammar

The Shape object has a symbol to separate what happens to which symbol. 
Followed Tabatha's Shape Grammar model. 
There are five ways for a shape to be changed, all with different possibilities.
All the models were made by me.

The environment is a fruit/produce town in the formation of StrawBerry Shortcakes brand.
